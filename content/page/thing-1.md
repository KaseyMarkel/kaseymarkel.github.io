This is a public bench I built on the shore of the bay area.

It's made out of a ton of two of pre-existing concrete that I used about 350 pounds of cement to combine into one solid item, along with a few chunks of rebar and a bunch of layers of paint.

At the beginning I mixed the concrete on site, as I got better at the project I started mixing it at home, then biking the 10 minutes to the location with wet concrete in 5 gallon buckets on my bike trailer.

I carried about a ton of sand from about 200m away where it was blocking a path, and made various mosaics and paintings along with some friends.
