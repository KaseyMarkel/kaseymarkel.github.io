The most consistently-updated places to find all of my academic papers are my  [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8285-3888) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yLxNBqcAAAAJ&hl=en) pages. 

Unfortunately, neither of those pages give me the option to provide commentary or summaries, of my favorite research projects, so I'll do so here. 

### Gall paper

[My gall paper](https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/698/7571489) was the first first-author paper of my PhD to be published, and is probably my most widely-ranging paper with respect to experimental techniques.
