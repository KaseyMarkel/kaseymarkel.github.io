The most consistently-updated places to find all of my academic papers are my  [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8285-3888) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yLxNBqcAAAAJ&hl=en) pages. 

Neither of those pages give me the option to explain the narrative arc of my academic career, nor to provide commentary or summaries of my favorite research projects - that's what this page is for.

### Narrative career arc
I did short stints in the [Daunert](https://umiamihealth.org/en/sylvester-comprehensive-cancer-center/research/labs/daunert-lab/research) and [Van Oijen](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/antoine-van-oijen) labs as an undergraduate, but spent last couple of years of my undergraduate research career working with the late [Jeff Prince](https://news.miami.edu/as/stories/2017/05/remembering-jeffrey-s-prince.html), using scanning and transmission electron microscopy to answer a variety of biological questions.

Inspired by conversations with my labmates in Prince Lab, I took a short time to perform my first independent set of experiments, renting out lab space at Colorado State University which culiminated in my **Plant learning paper**. I then went to Cambridge to work on chloroplast biotechnology with Jim Haseloff, leading to a handful of papers and an MPhil in plant biology.

I decided to return to the United States for my PhD, motivated by a frustration with the difficulty of performing field experiments using transgenic plants in the United Kingdom. Naturally, I came to the US University with the largest number of transgenic plant field experiments, University of California Davis. 

### Plant learning paper
My first, and likely only, solo experimental paper.

### Gall paper

[My gall paper](https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/698/7571489) was the first first-author paper of my PhD to be published, and is probably my most widely-ranging paper with respect to experimental techniques.
