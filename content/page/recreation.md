Outside of my academic work, I'm passionate about outdoor adventure sports and creative pursuits. Here are some of the activities I enjoy:

    <h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
    <p>Rock climbing combines physical challenge with problem-solving in beautiful natural settings. Whether it's bouldering, sport climbing, or traditional climbing, I love the mental and physical aspects of this sport.</p>

    <h2>Paragliding</h2>
    <p>Flying through the air with nothing but a wing and harness is an incredible experience. Paragliding offers a unique perspective on the world below and the freedom of flight.</p>

    <h2>Backpacking</h2>
    <p>Exploring remote wilderness areas with everything I need on my back is one of my favorite ways to disconnect and reconnect with nature. There's something special about waking up to a sunrise in the backcountry.</p>

## Making Things

I enjoy working with my hands and creating things, whether it's woodworking, electronics projects, or other DIY endeavors. There's satisfaction in bringing an idea from concept to reality.
