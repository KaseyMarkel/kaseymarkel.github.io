Outside of my academic work, I'm passionate about outdoor adventure sports and creative pursuits. Here are some of the activities I enjoy:

## Rock Climbing

Rock climbing combines physical challenge with problem-solving in beautiful natural settings. Whether it's bouldering, sport climbing, or traditional climbing, I love the mental and physical aspects of this sport.

## Paragliding

Flying through the air with nothing but a wing and harness is an incredible experience. Paragliding offers a unique perspective on the world below and the freedom of flight.

## Wingfoiling

Wingfoiling combines elements of windsurfing, kitesurfing, and foiling into one exciting water sport. It's a relatively new discipline that's rapidly growing in popularity.

## Backpacking

Exploring remote wilderness areas with everything I need on my back is one of my favorite ways to disconnect and reconnect with nature. There's something special about waking up to a sunrise in the backcountry.

## Making Things

I enjoy working with my hands and creating things, whether it's woodworking, electronics projects, or other DIY endeavors. There's satisfaction in bringing an idea from concept to reality.
